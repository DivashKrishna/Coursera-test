              The modern chicken is a descendant of red junglefowl hybrids along with the grey junglefowl first raised thousands of years ago in the northern parts of the Indian subcontinent.[4]
              Chicken as a meat has been depicted in Babylonian carvings from around 600 BC.[5] Chicken was one of the most common meats available in the Middle Ages.[6][7] For thousands of years, a number of different kinds of chicken have been eaten across most of the Eastern hemisphere,[8] including capons, pullets, and hens. It was one of the basic ingredients in blancmange, a stew usually consisting of chicken and fried onions cooked in milk and seasoned with spices and sugar.[9]
              In the United States in the 1800s, chicken was more expensive than other meats and it was "sought by the rich because [it is] so costly as to be an uncommon dish."[10] Chicken consumption in the U.S. increased during World War II due to a shortage of beef and pork.[11] In Europe, consumption of chicken overtook that of beef and veal in 1996, linked to consumer awareness of Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (mad cow disease)
              Does the implementation use inline CSS styles at all (not allowed) or does it reference an external CSS file?
              Is the default navbar implemented such that it scrolls away with the page, i.e., it's not statically attached to the top of bottom of the screen?
              Does the brand name "Food, LLC" properly aligned to the left of the navbar and does it use navbar-brand class?
              Is the dropdown menu button only visible when the browser is narrow enough to be in mobile view?
              Does clicking the dropdown menu button make the dropdown menu to slide down? Does it take up the entire width of the browser (minus some margins)? Is the label of the each menu item (e.g., "Chicken") centered using a Bootstrap class?
              Is the page heading, "Our Menu", centered on the screen using the Bootstrap class?
              Is the single cell section (or multiple sections as per optional part of the assignment) using the Bootstrap Grid System and is the section tall enough to force the viewer to scroll if they wanted to get to the bottom of the page.
